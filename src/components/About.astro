          <p>
            Most people who care about effective giving figure it out alone. They read the research, weigh the options, and make decisions in isolation. LEGC exists because giving well is better as a shared practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're a London community where people who take giving seriously come together regularly — to sharpen their thinking, share what they've learned, and stay motivated over the long term. No lectures, no pressure. Just thoughtful people helping each other follow through.
          </p>
          <p class="font-medium text-slate-800">
            Whether you've been giving effectively for years or you're ready to start, there's a place for you here.
