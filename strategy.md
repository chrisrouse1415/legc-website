2026 Strategy
The London Effective Giving Community (LEGC) exists to increase meaningful effective giving pledges and to support people in becoming better, more confident practitioners of effective giving over time. It is an in-person community designed for action, reflection, and sustained engagement, not abstract and passive discussion.
LEGC is for people who already give effectively or are seriously considering long-term, structured giving. It prioritises evidence, judgement, and follow-through. It is not optimised for casual interest, armchair philosophy, or general networking.
LEGC's core value proposition is an in-person community of practice on effective giving that cannot be replicated by online resources or one-off events. Members benefit from repeated exposure to peers who take giving seriously without ideological pressure, shared norms around uncertainty and decision-making, and social reinforcement that turns inspiration and intention into sustained behaviour.
LEGC runs three complementary event formats that together form a practice loop:
Themed events (every 30-45 days) set standards and deepen practice through workshops, panels, or debates. Each event improves a concrete skill, judgement, or behaviour related to effective giving, rather than deliver passive content.
Quarterly Strategy Sprints provide dedicated time and peer support for serious reflection and concrete progress on impact and giving decisions.
Monthly socials are a lower-barrier entry point to maintain continuity and trust. It is a space for conversations about effective giving as both a morally ambitious idea and a concrete, fulfilling practice.
Across all activities, LEGC maintains a positive, inspiring, and invitational tone, and enforces standards through design and culture rather than explicit gatekeeping. It is not a general Effective Altruism group, or a career networking space.
We measure success by increased pledges, improved judgement and confidence in giving decisions, and the presence of a sustained community of practice where reflection and action are the norm. Activities that do not meaningfully support these outcomes should be revised or discontinued.
